## Welcome to my github profile!

Check out my current project:  [Looseleaf Galaxy](http://www.looseleafgalaxy.space) ðŸš€ 

I built the front-end using React and Redux. The backend uses NodeJs and MongoDB.

Some key features: 

Frontend:
- An adorable space clicker game where you mine resources and sell them when the price is as high as possible.
- Buy resources when they are low, sell when they are high.
- Random sectors generated when hopping around the galaxy.

Backend:
- A live server for resource market prices that update every hours based on a Google Trends API query.
- My own auth server (using bcrypt and jason web tokens)
- Game data (prices and some game logic) stored on MongoDB.
- Player data stored on MongoDB.

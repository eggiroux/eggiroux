## Welcome to my github profile!
My name is Etienne Giroux (he/him), I'm a recent graduate from a full-stack web development bootcamp at Concordia University in Montreal.

Here is my [LinkedIn profile!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/egiroux/)

Check out my current project:  [Looseleaf Galaxy](http://www.looseleafgalaxy.space) ðŸš€

I built the front-end using React and Redux. The backend uses NodeJs and MongoDB.


Some key features: 

Frontend:
- An adorable space clicker game where you mine resources and sell them when the price is as high as possible.
- Buy resources when they are low, sell when they are high.
- Manage your limited inventory to cash in when the opportunity arises!
- Upgrade your shoddy little space ship to travel the galaxy, and to store more cargo!
- Random sectors generated when hopping around the galaxy.


_Trade all sorts of space resources to make space profits and upgrade your ship!!_

Backend:
- A live server for resource market prices that update every hours based on a Google Trends API query.
- My own auth server (using bcrypt and jason web tokens) -- made available in my repos for easy reuse in the future.
- Game data (prices and some game logic) stored on MongoDB.
- Player data stored on MongoDB.

_In Looseleaf Galaxy, prices fluctuate in real time!_

I hope you have fun!
